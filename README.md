# üé¨ **Filmoria: A Comprehensive Movie Recommendation & Recognition System**

Welcome to **Filmoria**, an innovative mobile application that revolutionizes the movie-watching experience. Whether you're looking for tailored movie recommendations, curious about a short reel you've watched, or need a movie suggestion via chatbot, Filmoria has you covered!

---

## üöÄ **Features**
- **Personalized Movie Recommendations**: Suggests movies based on user preferences such as favorite genres or specific movies.
- **Reel Detection**: Allows users to input reel links and identifies the movie name and the cast members appearing in the reel.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Chat with our NLP-powered chatbot to receive suggestions like:
  - "I liked *Interstellar*. What should I watch next?"
  - "Recommend action movies!"
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed using Flutter for seamless navigation and engaging visuals.

---

## üìö **How It Works**
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - **IMDbPY**: Extracts movie metadata (title, overview, rating, etc.).
   - **TMDb API**: Provides high-resolution actor images and reel detection support.
   - **MovieLens Dataset**: Includes user preferences, ratings, and tags for collaborative filtering.
   - **IMDb Database**: Fetches reviews, cast, and director details.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and prepared datasets for machine learning models using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and IMDbPY.
   - Enhanced data representation with techniques like tokenization and semantic embeddings.
3. **Recommendation System**:
   - Final model powered by **DistilBERT-base-uncased** for meaningful feature extraction.
   - Models experimented with include cosine similarity, LSTM, bi-directional LSTM, and LLAMA models.
4. **Reel Detection**:
   - Utilizes **OpenCV**, **face_recognition**, and **yt_dlp** for video processing and actor identification.
5. **Deployment**:
   - Backend system developed using **Flask** for real-time recommendations and chatbot responses.
   - Frontend built with **Flutter** for cross-platform compatibility.
